# HostHelper
[Here's the code :D](HostHelper.py)

---
As a frequent host in largescale events, this bot serves as my assistant! I have a server in which I organize events that take place at my house, and this bot helps me with crowd management and automated preparation.

Wrapped in antique elegance and aristocratic aesthetics, "𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑀𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑙𝑒𝑦 𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒" is a Discord server built to support the community that surrounds me and my house. I've designed and executed this server all on my own, with the help of Sapphire and ChatGPT. Given that this server was meant to be a means of effective planning and communication, I optimized it for mobile use, though it still stands as a capable desktop server despite the emojis rendering a bit different.

The bot's presence in the server acts as a personification of my house. Online means the house is open to visitors, while do not disturb means the house is closed. Fun fact, the pfp is a picture of my dishware. Isn't that neat?
