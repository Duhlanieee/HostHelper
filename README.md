# HostHelper
Discord bot I made for myself :)

I have a server in which I organize largescale events that take place at my house. This bot is my assistant in crowd management and automated preparation.

Wrapped in antique elegance and aristocratic aesthetics, "𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑀𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑙𝑒𝑦 𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒" is a Discord server built to support the community that surrounds me and my house. I've designed and executed this server all on my own accord, with the help of the bot [Sapphire](https://sapph.xyz) and ChatGPT. Given that this server was meant to be a means of effective planning and communication, I optimized it for mobile use, though it still stands as a capable desktop server despite the emojis rendering a bit different.
